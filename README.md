## The Signinator

I want a sign hanging on my office door, whose text can be updated with a simple MQTT message. The message can be sent with whatever script and that's more or less that. This project is intended as a self-hosted solution and is developed with the Eclipse Mosquitto broker. The target board is a Pi Pico W.

The development platform at present is a HUB75 64x64 LED Matrix from WaveShare

## TODO
Configure TLS

Refactor terminal app to a GUI tool for better administration of signs
  
Create Provision GUI tool to quickly create new signs

Bedtime (blank at certain time/wake back up)
